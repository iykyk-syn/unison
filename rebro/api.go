// Package rebro enables:
//   - High throughput censorship resistant certificates
//   - Dynamic and randomized quorums
//   - Customization of hashing functions and signing schemes, including aggregatable signatures.
//   - Customization of broadcasting algorithms and networking stacks
//   - Custom quorum fault parameters and sizes.
//
// A trivial consensus algorithm to implement here would be to:
// * Require full quorum as finalization condition
// * Order blocks by public keys of quorum participants lexicographically

// partial synchrony. It enables parallel quorum certificates and multiple broadcasters can propose

// (leader-based or mesh-based) by decoupling certificate data structure.

// It signs over broadcasted MessageIDs automatically after verifying them using Signer.
